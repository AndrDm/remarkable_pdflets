This is a simple pdflet to be a guide when writing new pdflets.

Anywhere you see `UUID`, you should replace it with a [version 4 uuid](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4).

Anywhere you see `TEMPLATE`, you should replace it with your pdflet's name.

- `install.sh` - script for end users to easily install your pdflet
- `TEMPLATE.sh` - script which generates pdf when this pdflet is triggered
- `TEMPLATE.path` - path unit which tells sytemd to run `TEMPLATE.service` when it detects that the user has closed the document
- `TEMPLATE.service` - simple systemd unit to trigger `TEMPLATE.sh`
- `UUID.metadata` - where xochitl stores document information.  set the document title here
- `UUID.pdf` - output generated by `TEMPLATE.sh`. xochitl only reads this file when `UUID.cache/0.jpg` is deleted (which happens in `TEMPLATE.sh`)

Verify everything has been renamed properly:
``` bash
# should return nothing
grep UUID *
grep TEMPLATE *
find . -name "*UUID*"
find . -name "*TEMPLATE*"
```
